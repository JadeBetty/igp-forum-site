In this post, we will create a Workflow which updates our GitHub Profile with out latest Blogs on dev.to. To do this, you will need:

- A GitHub Account
- A little of passion

## LINKS:

- My GitHub (You can find an example here) - https://github.com/Zemerik/Zemerik
- YouTube Video - https://youtu.be/As7KgTZOrlE
- Source code - https://gist.github.com/Zemerik/ebb6f6af7c64173adf22aab5cd2c68a7
- Support - https://discord.gg/td5xqmzEcg

## 1. SET UP README.MD

- The first step in this process, is to define where we want our blogs. To do that, copy paste the following code in your README.md where you want your blogs:

```
<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:END -->
```

> NOTE: Your blogs will be showing in the middle of the two comments. 

## 2. WORKFLOW

- The next step in this process is to create a workflow to update our README. 

- Create a `blog-post-workflow.yml` file in the `.github/workflows/` directory. Ensure your directory has no typo's!

- We now need to write the workflow in the file which we created. Copy paste the code below into that file:

```yml
name: ðŸ“šBlogs
on:
  schedule:
    # Runs every hour
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-readme-with-blog:
    name: âœ…Update with latest Blogs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master
        with:
          max_post_count: "4"
          feed_list: "https://dev.to/feed/YOUR DEV.TO USERNAME HERE"
```

> Remember to add your Dev.to username at the end of the URL on the last line
